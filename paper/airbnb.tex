\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart
New York City is one of America's most visited cities, with iconic monuments like the
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, a vibrant arts and cultural scene,
and an enviable conentration of bars and restaurants catering to every taste and budget.
It's a vast city including hundreds of neighborhoods each with their unique
history, economy, and character. The city attracted nearly 60 million visitors in 2015,
with a year over year growth of about 2 million vistors a year since 2010.\cite{nyc_and_company_nyc_nodate} Of course,
all these visitors need a place to stay.

Airbnb provides a platform for residents to rent space in their homes and apartments.
Founded in 2008, Airbnb's mission is to help people "monetize their extra space." They've
been very successful, with over 3 million listings in over 65,000 cities worldwide.\cite{airbnb_about_us}

\section{Literature Review}



\section{Data and Methods}
The four datasets collected for the analysis include:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Asthma Hospitilization Discharge Rate\cite{noauthor_information_nodate}
%   \item Building Energy Usage\cite{noauthor_gbee_nodate}
%   \item Neighborhood Income\cite{bureau_american_nodate}
%   \item Neighborhood Population\cite{bureau_american_nodate}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Asthma Hospitilization Discharge Rate}
Asthma hospitilization data was collected from New York State's Department of Health (NYDOH).
The NYDOH publishes hospital discharge numbers collected by the Statewide Planning
and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). For this dataset, they focus only on hospital
discharges where the principal diagnosis was asthma. This dataset is a three-year average
over the years 2012 to 2014. The discharge rate per zip code is the total number of discharges
divided by the average population of that zip code over the same three-year span. Certain
zip codes with particularly low discharge rates are redacted for privacy reasons.

NYDOH publishes the data on their website as tables per county but they do not provide
a direct download. The data was collected by scraping the NYDOH website for
the five counties in New York City: Kings, Richmond, New York, Bronx, and Queens. Zip
codes without enough discharges to be published because of privacy and those with
such a low count to have a Relative Standard Error of greater than 30\% were also dropped.
This resulted in a total of 173 zip codes of asthma data.

\subsection{Building Energy Usage}
Local Law 84 in New York City requires owners of large buildings (and soon to be mid-sized
buildings) to benchmark the energy usage of their properties and submit this data
in a consistent way to the city. These benchmarks have come to cover many different
energy and pollution related attributes. The two attributes relevant to this study are
Site EUI (kBtu/ft2) and Direct GHG Emissions (MtCO2e). Site Energy Use Intensity is the
amount of energy consumed by the property in British thermal units per gross square foot.
Direct GHG Emissions are the total greenhouse gases emitted by the property in metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Site EUI is used to understand the energy intensity of a building, while Direct Emissions
will be used to determine if there is a relationship between greenhouse gas emitting
buildings and asthma rates within an area. The data collected was for the year 2013.
This year was chosen to fit in the middle of the three-year average (2012-2014) collected for
asthma hospitilizaion.

The dataset comes as a list of individual buildings and their performance in many energy
related metrics. The buildings were grouped by zip code and their metrics summed to a list
of 181 zip codes with the total Site EUIs and Direct Emissions.

\subsection{Neighborhood Income and Population}
Neighborhood and Income data were collected through the American Census Bureau's website.
The data comes from the American Community Survey 5-year average over the years 2011-2015.
These years were selected to overlap with the asthma hospitalization rates as much as possible.
The attributes collected include household median income, income per capita, and total
population per zip code tabulation area.

\subsection{Merging}
The dataset was merged by zip code. As much as zip codes are not the ideal demographic
tabulation unit, they were necessary in this analysis as they provided the smallest level
of resolution available for asthma hosptilization rates. The American Community Survey
has its own proxy for zip code knows as a Zip Code Tabulation Area. ZCTAs allow for easy
merging with other zip code indexed data. After merging all datasets, and dropping
any zip codes that did not have all attributes available, primarily because of low number
of asthma cases, 164 zip codes remained from the original 181.

\subsection{Mapping}
An important way to understand data of this kind is to see it on a map.
To map the data, a shapefile of zip code boundaries was downloaded from NYC Open Data.

\section{Results}
The two primary questions this project aims to answer is is what, if any, relationship there is between
building energy use and direct emissions to local asthma hospitilization rates. These results
will be compared to how income affects energy use and asthma hospitilization rates.

\subsection{Visualization}

When comparing the maps of energy use and emissions, it is also not surprising to see
similar patterns emerge as well. It makes sense to see Manhattan being the most energy
intensive, but it is somewhat surprising to see that Manhattan also has some of the highest
concentration of direct emissions.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The results above are not what one might intuitively expect. There is essentially
no relationship between energy use of buildings or their direct emissions of greenhouse
gases on the asthma hospitilization rates of the zip code in which they are located.
Instead, a much better indicator of the severe asthma rate in a region is the median
household income. This might lead one to believe that the healthcare and living conditions
provided by higher wealth have a much larger impact in New York City on developing
and treating asthma than environmental factors. This analysis is not comprehensive
enough to make that kind of conclusion, though, as there very well may be other environmental
factors that are not taken into account by the building energy dataset that cause
asthma. It may also be that greater wealth clusters people in regions with lower environmental
contagions, which result in the relationship between wealth and asthma. Futher analysis is
needed.

It does appear that wealthier neighborhoods use less energy than those that are less
wealthy, though this relationship is not particularly strong. This may be
the result of new buildings built with higher efficiency HVAC systems and better
insulation. Regardless, the trend is not very strong and would require further
investigation to understand how higher wealth may result in lower building energy use.

As it stands, the strongest insight provided by this analysis is that the wealthier
a neighborhood, the lower the number of asthma-related hospitilizations take place.
